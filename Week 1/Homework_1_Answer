# Decentralised Systems

Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be
like, if there was no software on a central server.
How would you solve the problems of:

- Cheating

To solve the problem of cheating, the game could include a system where all players have to agree on any transactions, such as buying or selling properties. This could be done using a consensus algorithm where all players have to agree before a transaction is accepted.

- Ensuring agreement about the state of the system

To ensure agreement about the state of the system, the game could include a distributed ledger where all players can see the current state of the game board, including which properties are owned by which players, how much money each player has, and so on. This would allow all players to verify the state of the game board and make sure that no one is cheating.

- Communication problems (timeouts)

Communication problems, such as timeouts, could be addressed by using a peer-to-peer communication protocol that allows players to communicate directly with each other. This could be done using a protocol like BitTorrent or IPFS, which are designed to work in a decentralized environment.



- How to decide who should take the next turn.

Deciding who should take the next turn could be done using a round-robin system, where each player takes turns in a predetermined order. Alternatively, players could use a bidding system to determine who goes first, with the highest bidder getting the first turn.


- How to allow the correct people to join the game

Allowing the correct people to join the game could be done using a secure authentication system, where each player has to prove their identity using a cryptographic key. This would prevent unauthorized players from joining the game and would ensure that only legitimate players are able to participate.
