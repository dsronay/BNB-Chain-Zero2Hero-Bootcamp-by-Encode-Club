For the Dog coin contract I created (https://github.com/dsronay/BNB-Chain-Zero2Hero-Bootcamp-by-Encode-Club/blob/main/DogCoin.sol)

1. Add an internal function called _mint to increase the total supply, any increase in supply should be given to the contract owner.

2. Add some unit tests to test the following:
a. The total supply can be increased in steps of 1000
b. Only the owner can increase the total supply
c. The correct events are produced when transfers occur.
