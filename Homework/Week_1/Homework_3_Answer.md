The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a way to interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum network. It defines how the contract's functions can be called, what arguments are required, and what values are returned. The ABI is generated by the compiler when the smart contract is compiled into bytecode. It provides a standardized way for different applications to interact with the same contract on the Ethereum network.

The bytecode, on the other hand, is the actual machine code that is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the Ethereum network. It is the compiled version of your contract's Solidity code and contains all the instructions necessary to execute your contract's functions.

So, in summary, the ABI defines how to interact with your contract, and the bytecode is the compiled version of your contract's code that is executed by the EVM. The ABI and bytecode are related because the ABI is generated by the compiler based on your contract's code and is used to interact with the contract on the Ethereum network.
